# Cloud Terms
Best-practice, balanced, open source SaaS/cloud subscription terms

## About Bonterms
[Bonterms](https://bonterms.com/) provides best-practice, balanced, open source legal forms for the enterprise. Bonterms forms are standard forms that you modify as necessary for your transaction through a Cover Page. Make sure to have a lawyer review Bonterms forms before use in any circumstance.

## How the Cloud Terms were Created
The Cloud Terms were drafted by the [Bonterms Open Source Forms Committee](https://bonterms.com/committee/). The Cloud Terms went through six major drafts, three sub-committees (Data, Risk and General Terms) and multiple meetings, surveys and discussions over seven months.

## How to Use
1. **Review** the Cloud Terms with your lawyer.
2. **Prepare** your Cover Page ([example](https://bonterms.com/#download-cloud-terms)).
- Identify the parties, Effective Date and other **Key Terms**.
- Propose any **Additional Terms** ([examples](https://bonterms.com/#download-cloud-terms)).
- Attach any Support, SLA, DPA or other **Attachments**
3. **Send** your Cover Page (and Attachments) to your counterparty.
- Add a cover note or try our [Explainer](https://bonterms.com/#download-cloud-terms).
4. **Negotiate** the Cover Page and Attachments.
5. **Sign** the Cover Page and create your **Cloud Agreement**!
6. **Issue** or receive Orders ([example](https://bonterms.com/#download-cloud-terms)).
