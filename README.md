# Cloud Terms
Enterprise SaaS/Cloud subscription terms, balanced between customer and provider.

## About Bonterms
[Bonterms](https://bonterms.com/) is simplifying commercial contracting through Standard Agreements. Our enterprise Cloud Terms (with DPA and SLA Attachments), Professional Services Agreement (PSA) and Mutual NDA let the parties start from a balanced foundation and negotiate by Cover Page, not redlines. The Bonterms Platform will leverage our Standard Agreements to take collaborative dealmaking to the next level. Bonterms is lawyer-led and funded by XYZ Capital and Wilson Sonsini.

## How the Cloud Terms were Created
The Cloud Terms were drafted by the [Bonterms Open Source Forms Committee](https://bonterms.com/committee/). The Cloud Terms went through six major drafts, three sub-committees (Data, Risk and General Terms) and multiple meetings, surveys and discussions over seven months.

## How to Use
1. **Review** the Cloud Terms with your lawyer.
2. **Prepare** your Cover Page ([example](https://bonterms.com/forms/cloud-terms-cover-page-example/)).

- Propose any **Additional Terms** ([examples](https://bonterms.com/forms/additional-terms-toolkit/)).
- Name the Agreement you are creating (for example, “Cloud Services Agreement”).
3. **Incorporate** any Attachments by reference ([example](https://bonterms.com/forms/additional-terms-toolkit/#attachments)).
